                        <h4>Linked-Grad Overview</h4>
                        <p>Often, students ask instructors to be a reference for them as they leave school to look for work. In order for an instructor to be a reference, the student must complete a "Student Record Reference Request Consent" form (see sample below). This has worked well for the "traditional" means of being a reference (students giving potential employers the instructor's contact information and then employers contacting by phone, email, etc. to ask questions about the student as a potential employee). Where it fails is in the current world of web-based resumes and endorsements.</p>
                        <p>On the web, students may choose to set up profiles and/or resumes on various kinds of sites, such as Linked-In, <u>[MORE SAMPLES]</u>. In those contexts, students may want instructors to act as a reference or to "endorse" them for certain skills, abilities, or characteristics. What makes these online references/endorsements unique is that they easily become "perpetual", whereas the typical reference request has an expiry (e.g.: 1 year).</p>
                        <h4>Sample Student Record Reference Request Consent</h4>
                        <p>I, <input type="text" name="studentName" /> request that <input type="text" name="instructorNames" /> write a letter of reference or respond to a reference check on my behalf.</p>
                        <p>I understand that <input type="text" name="instructorNames" /> will have to disclose personal information regarding myself including grades, attendance information and personal characteristics, in order to write a letter of reference or respond to a reference check on my behalf and I consent to this disclosure.</p>
                        <p>I consent to the disclosure of my above described personal information:</p>
                        <p>
                            <input type="checkbox" name="limitedDisclosure" id="limitedDisclosure" />

                        </p>
                        <p>This consent will be effective for a period of <input type="text" name="disclosurePeriod" /> after the signature date.</p>
                        <p>
                            <label for="studentSignature">Signature</label>
